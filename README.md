# log-analyzer
A simple log analyzer built in Python

# What this program does
This is a simple file input, output script. It reads log.txt (or whatever file name you make it) and it reads through the file line by line.

This script logs down:
- Amount of failed lines
- Amount of info lines
- Amount of warning lines
- Total amount of lines.

Once the script has finished running youll be able to see the results listed above in the file report.txt, (or whatever filename you choose).
